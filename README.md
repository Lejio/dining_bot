# UMBC Dining Bot
A email dining bot that sends an email to all its users a list of everything that's on the menu today.

Currently we have a manual list that contains all the emails. Everyday at 6:00am in the morning, it would execute the script on AWS EC2 and sends everyone a email of today's menu.
